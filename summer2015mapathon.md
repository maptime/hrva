#Maptime HRVA Summer OSM Mapathon  

This weekend MaptimeHRVA , organized by [myself](https://twitter.com/jonahadkins) and [Alex Kappel](https://twitter.com/alex_kappel), held a summer OpenStreetMap Mapathon in Williamsburg, Va.   

We had about 10 attendees throughout the day, with editors ages ranging from 11 to Over 40. OSM is super easy for most anyone to immediately understand and pick-up, which is why it’s a great platform for teaching basic map concepts and components. More importantly, this low barrier of entry makes it simple to spark interest in the next generation of developers, mappers, and users! 

Here’s our [quick stats](http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/) from the event:
* Number of OSM Contributors: 7
* Number of Map Changes: 8,462
* Total number of Changesets: 44 
* Number of created (modified) Nodes: 5,992 (469)
* Number of created (modified) Ways: 681 (235)
* Number of created (modified) Highways: 356 (170)
* Number of created Buildings: 162 

I don’t know about you but i’d say that’s a success.
